# Fault-diagnosis-of-industrial-rotating-machinery
Through the vibration data returned by the end-side vibration sensor, the algorithm is writed to realize the task of equipment fault diagnosis and analysis across working conditions and even across equipment, and to help realize the maintenance strategy arrangement in the real production process. \
The algorithm for the first file uses the DAN network with MMD loss. \
